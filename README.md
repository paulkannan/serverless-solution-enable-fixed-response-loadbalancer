Most of the Organisations have to implement maintenance window for their On-premises and AWS workloads. This Serverless solution offers a static response mechanism at the Application Load Balancer (ALB) level, effectively serving as a maintenance window for AWS workloads. By using this approach, organizations can easily display a customized message to users during maintenance periods without the need for additional AWS resources like a static website hosted in S3 or Lambda functions.

**Advantages of this approach:**

**Simplicity and Cost-Effectiveness:** Implementing a static response at the ALB level requires minimal configuration and avoids the overhead of setting up and maintaining additional AWS resources. This can lead to cost savings for organizations, especially for small-scale or occasional maintenance requirements.

**Centralized Management:** Managing the maintenance response directly at the ALB allows for centralized control over the response content. Any changes or updates to the maintenance message can be made directly within the Terraform code, ensuring consistency across all instances served by the ALB.

**Fast Response:** The static response is delivered at the load balancer level, enabling quick responses to user requests during maintenance windows. There's no need to wait for Lambda functions or website resources to spin up, reducing latency for users.

**Load Balancer Flexibility:** The use of ALB's listener rules provides flexibility to define different maintenance scenarios based on various conditions like user-agent, referrer, or source IP address. This allows organizations to target specific user groups or regions with different maintenance messages if required.

**No External Dependencies:** Unlike a static website hosted in S3, this solution does not have any external dependencies. The ALB can serve the maintenance response directly without relying on external services or network calls.
